## üöÄ Featured Projects

### 1. Airbnb Revenue Prediction
**Summary:** This project develops a machine learning model to predict annual revenue for Airbnb listings in the Northeast U.S., helping hosts and platforms make more informed decisions around pricing, features, and listing management.  

### 2. Kickstarter Campaign Success Prediction
**Summary:** This project explores whether the success of a crowdfunding campaign can be predicted using only the metadata available before launch. Leveraging a large dataset of over 160,000 Kickstarter projects, the goal is to assist creators in optimizing campaigns and help platforms surface high-potential projects.  

### 3. Anxiety Study
**Summary:** This project uses self-reported lifestyle, physiological, and behavioral data to predict the **severity of anxiety attacks** on a scale of 1‚Äì10. The goal is to help healthcare providers, mental health practitioners, and individuals identify high-risk situations and take preventative action.

### 4. Netflix Genre Optimization
**Summary:** This project analyzes trends in Netflix‚Äôs most-watched films and series using data from the **Netflix Global Top 10**. The goal is to provide executives with actionable insights for **content investment**, **global expansion**, and **runtime optimization**.  

### 5. Caselaw Analysis
**Summary:** This project explores fine-tuning a ChatGPT model using the **Caselaw Access Project (CAP)** dataset to classify legal case outcomes as "Favorable" or "Unfavorable." The goal is to test the feasibility, costs, and methodology of creating a domain-specific legal AI model.

### 6. RAG
**Summary:** This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using the **LangChain** framework and OpenAI embeddings. The objective is to retrieve relevant context from Wikipedia, store it in a vector database, and generate LLM responses grounded in that retrieved context.

### 7. TSA Analysis
**Summary:** This project analyzes Transportation Security Administration (TSA) customer complaint data from 2015‚Äì2019 to help **TSA Regional Operations Executives** and **Airport Managers** identify high-risk airports and problem categories, enabling targeted operational improvements.  

### 8. US Childcare
**Summary:** This project analyzes trends and disparities in childcare costs across the United States from 2008‚Äì2022, providing insights for policymakers, educators, and advocates working to improve access and affordability.  

### 9. Clinical Trials
**Summary:** This project uses metadata from the **Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT)** to predict the likelihood of a clinical trial‚Äôs success based on its design features. The goal is to help **pharmaceutical companies**, **research sponsors**, and **regulatory strategists** make more informed decisions before and during trial execution.

### 10. Stack Overflow Prediction
**Summary:** This project analyzes the **2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey** to identify predictors of job satisfaction and the likelihood of job change among developers. The goal is to help **technology companies** improve retention strategies and assist **developers** in assessing job fit.
