## 📈 Exploratory Analysis
- **National Trend**: Costs rose ~50% from 2008 to 2022, outpacing inflation.
- **Regional Disparities**: Urban areas averaged ~$200/week, suburban ~$150/week, rural ~$120/week.
- **State Comparisons**: High-cost states include D.C. and New Jersey; lowest costs in rural-heavy states.
- **Affordability Burden**: In some high-cost states, childcare consumes a disproportionate share of household income.
